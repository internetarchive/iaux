Hello, this is a very specific instance of BookReader that is being used on Archive.org.

Currently, we are in the middle of moving our BookReader to version 5 and our current scripts we be in flux until we move out of beta.
This current version of the music player with liner is specifically using archive.org scripts to load the navigation web component.

Final upgrades to this music player will be complete once we finalize its UX.

For tips on how to load this music player, please refer to the `<head>` section of `~/.storybook/preview-head.html` where you can find the scripts to run the player.

Thanks in advance.  Do let us know if you have any concerns, suggestions by making an issue.

Best, Isa HV
