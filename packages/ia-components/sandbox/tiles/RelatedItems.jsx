 *    identifier = string Identifier of item displaying related items for
 *    members = [ ArchiveMember ]
 *           or [ { object } ]  where object has the fields of a member (as returned by Gio's related api) as required for TileComponent
 *    disconnected = BOOL       True if browser cannot see archive.org
 * />
 * RelatedItems is a component intended for the bottom of details page to display related items.
 * It should be called either with members=[member*] in which case it will render them immediately
 * dweb-archive uses RelatedItemsWrapper that has the functionality of loading the related item from an "item" or "identifier"
 *
 * It should be easy to build a wrapper to hook this into IAUX's (underdeveloped) related items service if anyone wants to use that.
 *
 * Members are, or should look like, ArchiveMember as defined in the dweb-archivecontroller repo. or as returned by Gio's related API
 *
 * Its currently used in dweb-archive/Details.js via RelatedItemsWrapper which finds the Members
 * For use without dweb-archivecontroller it will need to call the Related Items API and pass the results here.
